# git-jira hook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pgjerlow/git-jira-hook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pgjerlow/git-jira-hook)


The git-jira hook is a small application which is installed on every developers' machine in order to check and control that checked-in changes are linked to a correct JIRA issue according to configurable states.<br>
The reason for using a component like this is to minimize the risk of code changes erroneously being delivered into production in the end.<br><br>
This git-hook is implemented based on the experiences of similar component designed for several earlier engagements by me and other colleagues.
