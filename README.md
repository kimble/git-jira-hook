# git-jira hook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pgjerlow/git-jira-hook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pgjerlow/git-jira-hook)

# Background
For a project in a management regime it's particularly important to have control over what changes are being checked-in and that these are linked to a JIRA-issues which will be a part of a delivery.<br>
At the moment there's no communication between git and JIRA, so there is a risk of code changes erroneously being delivered into production.<br><br>
This git-hook is implemented based on the experiences of similar component designed for several earlier engagements by me and other colleagues.

For more information about the git-jira hook please take a look at the Wiki.
